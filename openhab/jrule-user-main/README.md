# jrule-user

The purpose of this repo is to provide a template for developing rule using https://github.com/seaside1/jrule (Java Rules in OpenHAB).
The output will be a jar containing the user defined rules. The jar-file can be added to JRule in OpenHAB
Requirements
- Java 11
- Maven 3.x+

## Step by step install
1. Clone repo git clone https://github.com/seaside1/jrule-user/
2. Run maven to build: maven clean install
3. Import project or build in your preferred IDEA (Intellij, Eclipse etc)
4. Start developing and adding rules to your org.openhab.automation.jrule.rules.user package
5. Build with mvn install and deploy it in OpenHAB by placing the created jar-file (jrule-user-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) under:  /etc/automation/jrule/rules-jar/

## Dependencies 
The project is depending on some jars:

1. jrule-items.jar (This file is containing some sample items see https://github.com/seaside1/jrule-user/blob/main/items/jrule-user.items
2. jrule.jar (Dependency on latest snapshot of https://github.com/seaside1/jrule
3. junit-jupiter (For JUnit 5)
4. Mockito (For mocking rules)
5. Variouse OpenHAB core dependencies

## Testing
In order to test Java Rules using JUnit and mockito the OpenHAB Eventbus has 
a mock implementation https://github.com/seaside1/jrule/tree/main/src/main/java/org/openhab/automation/jrule/internal/test
This implementation is really simple and only supports ItemStateChangedEvents for now. Feel free to expand it
and anything needed in order to test Java Rules. If possible submit a PR with changes

Using the MockEventBus you can add a textfile with actual OpenHAB Events. You typically find these events looking at
/var/log/openhab/events.log

```

We add a rule: https://github.com/seaside1/jrule-user/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openhab/automation/jrule/rules/user/MyFirstRules.java

```java
    @JRuleName("testRuleZwave")
    @JRuleWhen(item = _MyPower1.ITEM, trigger = _MyPower1.TRIGGER_CHANGED)
    public synchronized void myFirstRule(JRuleEvent event) {
        logInfo("MyPower1 Changed! from: {} to: {}", event.getOldState(), event.getState());
    }
```
 
 In Order to test the rule, and see that myFirstRule is trigged two time we can add the following test:
 See: https://github.com/seaside1/jrule-user/blob/main/src/test/java/org/openhab/automation/jrule/rules/user/TestMyRules.java
 
```java
     @Test
   ` public void testMyRule() {
        JRuleEngine engine = JRuleEngine.get();
        JRuleConfig config = new JRuleConfig(new HashedMap<>());
        engine.setConfig(config);
        engine.add(myFirstRules);
        JRuleMockedEventBus eventBus = new JRuleMockedEventBus("eventlog.txt");
        eventBus.start();
        verify(myFirstRules, times(2)).myFirstRule(Mockito.any(JRuleEvent.class));
    }
```
This will simulate the eventbus, and add all events in the eventlog.txt. The engine will trigger the rule and the mock will verify
that it is called twice.
