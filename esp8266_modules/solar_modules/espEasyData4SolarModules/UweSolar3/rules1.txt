// 
// this rules have different tasks:
// - send status, temperature, pressure and battery status via MQTT
// - when not sending goto deep sleep for 4300  or 3600 sec to save battery power
//   NOTE: the deep sleep jump must be set (jumper next to the RST pin and the 'SET' position is close to the WEMOS board)
// - when pgm jumper (pin D5 of wemos d1 mini) goes zero (jumper connected, position close to WEMOS board)
//   do NOT enter deep sleep next cycle when pgm mode is true
//   if you cant wait (at least 3600s) just push the rest button
// - if pgm is set keep publishing values
// 
// General NOTE: if you want to flash a new software to the WEMOS (not loading new rules, this always work if not sleeping)
//               you will have to REMOVE the RST jumper which makes the connection from D0 - RST 
//               You might also place it to the other position away from WEMOS board
//               This connection is required to wake up after end of sleep.
//               When you are done with flasing and want to use the deep again please enable the jumper again
